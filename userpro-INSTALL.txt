1. INSTALLATION

- Please do not upload the whole file you download from CodeCanyon, extract your download first
- Upload the userpro.zip file only to your WordPress plugins
- Or unzip userpro.zip and upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
- Activate the plugin. That's it!

2. SEO, Pretty Permalinks Configuration

User Pro will create pages automatically for profile view, editing, registration and login, and members
directory. If you have pretty permalinks activated and want to enjoy links such as /profile/Username or /profile/edit/ 
Please open your WordPress dashboard after activating the plugin for first time only.

Go to Settings > Permalinks > click on Save changes without changing anything. That will activate nice URLs by User Pro!

3. Make sure that thumbs are working

Please make sure that lib/cache folder has proper CHMOD 755 or 777 and that the folder contains empty index file
and another file with .touch extension (0 byte) If you have problems viewing user thumbnails you need to check
the chmod of your lib/cache folder and these 2 files and make sure the folder is writeable.

4. Getting Started

By default, User Pro will automatically create pages for you for registering, login, profile, etc. If you wish
to customize your fields, you simply need to open WordPress dashboard > UserPro. The inteface has been made 
very easy to use, drag and drop fields around, re-order fields, remove fields you do not want. You can build
an unlimited number of fields and populate the form anyway you like depending on your needs.

5. Modifying plugin settings

Go to do UserPro > Global Options tab to change plugin settings. To make sure that pages are setup correctly, or
in case you want to edit the slugs of pages e.g. /profile/ to /myprofile/ or /register/ to /signup/ you can 
simply do this in the Setup Pages tab.

Please make sure that you save Permalink structure if you rebuild the pages or changed the page slugs when nice permalinks is active.
